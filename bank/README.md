In the bank application you can keep track of your bank transaction.
You can use it to write down your withdrawals and deposits, and have it displayed back to you in a statement with dates and balance.


I divided the functionality into tree classes, one for storing information about account, one for formatting statements and one for writing the transactions into account entries array.

You can use it by forking this repository, cloning it to your machine and running bundle.

If you want to run test, write rspec in your terminal.
